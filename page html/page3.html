			<h1>Chicken with Preserved Lemon and Olives</h1>
			<p>This classic, versatile dish is also one of Morocco's most famous . And no wonder! It's utterly delicious and works beautifully for any occasion ranging from casual family dinners to celebratory banquets. You'll find it offered in homes, restaurants and even on the street in tiny outdoor dining venues. Shown here is a Roasted chicken with preserved lemons and olives presentation, but the dish is also easily prepared in a traditional tagine or conventional pot. Lots of onions are cooked to a puree-like consistency with saffron and ginger; preserved lemons and olives are tangy additions to finish the dish.
