			<h1>Harira</h1>
			<p>You'll find all kinds of soups served in Moroccan homes and restaurants, but this one stands out from the crowd for being uniquely Moroccan and very much loved throughout the country. Variations are countless, but typically harira is a tomato-based soup laden with lentils and chickpeas. Rice or fine broken noodles (chaariya) are often added as well, while the stock is usually made with beef or lamb. This authentic Harira recipe does not fall into the quick and easy category, but the effort put into making it won't disappoint. </p>
